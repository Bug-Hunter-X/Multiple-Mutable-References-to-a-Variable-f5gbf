This repository contains a Rust code example that illustrates a subtle issue related to multiple mutable references to the same variable.  The `bug.rs` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.rs` offers a possible solution or explanation of how to avoid this type of issue.  The issue revolves around data races and the order of mutable borrows.  Understanding how to handle multiple mutable references effectively is crucial for writing safe and predictable Rust programs.
